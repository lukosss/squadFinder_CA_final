My Final project for Code Academy. A website I called Squadfinder, where You can find other people who play same games as you. After registering You can add played games to your profile, and search for other people by game, username, rank, etc. Once You find someone suitable, You can check out their contacts such as Discord, Steam, Origin, Epic games username, etc. Also there is an admin panel where admin can add new games to be selected by players and edit all the data. Project is 85% complete, but was enough for my 10 mark on my final assignment.
